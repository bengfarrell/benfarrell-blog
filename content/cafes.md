<h1>Cafes</h1>
I am still searching for a coffee house in the East Bay where I feel welcome to spend two hours working or reading without feeling like I’m taking up valuable table space and where others can use it to relax and hang out with friends. Yes, I’m talking about the elusive quest for a third space in America! Modern cafés with their sleek counters and perfectly positioned plants can be appealing and offer great coffee discoveries, but they don’t quite hit that vibe I enjoy most.

It’s a plus if they offer food or baked goods as well, but that’s secondary to the coffee and vibe. If the food is worthwhile, you can bet I’ll mention it, however!

When I want coffee, I want to actually taste the coffee, rather than sugar and milk. Thus, I do not visit boba shops often, nor bigger coffee chains. But I will absolutely order a mocha when I have a sweet tooth, especially one that also uses orange flavoring (Café Borgia, I love you!). I prefer oat or almond milk, because I’m not big on the taste of dairy—ice cream and cheese exempted, of course. If I’m getting anything where the foam matters most (cappuccino, macchiato, etc.), whole milk is best.

At present, a café au lait is the drink I’m most likely to order at a new-to-me café. It’s really easy to make, just equal parts steamed milk and drip coffee, but I’m often surprised at how few baristas are familiar with it. I do consider it a demerit if my beverage is served so hot that I’m likely to burn my tongue, but I also recognize that a bunch of you weirdos out there prefer that.

I will note if there are outlets available, whether it’s okay to hold a conversation or if the café is a quieter spot, and how much seating is generally available. Have a favorite spot? I’m happy to check it out!
