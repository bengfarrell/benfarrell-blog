**Mixed Reality Pavilion for Adobe Tech Summit | Moscone Center SF, February 2019**

Worked with my colleague Bhautik Joshi to gather submissions to demo at an internal Adobe Tech Summit, working with each exhibitor and event management to get everything running smoothly.

**Hands on Flex Session | NCDevCon May 22,2010**

Adrian Pomilio and I created beginner's applications and training material for this 2 hour hands on session.  We covered the basics of Flex, and then demonstrated how to build both a music player and Flickr photo viewer while the audience followed along

 

**Adobe Flex 4 for Coldfusion Developers Training Seminar | Teachers Assistant, November 2009**

Assisted David Tucker with a full day training seminar geared towards Coldfusion developers to train them for using the new Flex 4 Beta software for creating Coldfusion connected applications.  The event was challenging as Adobe only requested TA's days before the event.  Even though I was familiar with Flex 4, I had never used Coldfusion and didn't receive the training materials until the morning of the event.  Despite all this (with the help of two other TAs) the event was a big success.

 

**Harvard University | Teachers Assistant, 2003-2005**
