You’ll find my fiction under the name Rebecca Gomez Farrell, and my author website is <a href="https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com">here</a>. Fiction writing is my primary career, and I've had fantasy, horror, science fiction, and contemporary novels and short stories published. Check out my Wings Rising series [here](https://meerkatpress.com/series/wings-rising/). I've also published essays and recently won a silver ribbon for poetry at the Alameda County Fair!

_The Gourmez_ is more of an involved hobby . . . a hobby that’s resulted in multiple media mentions and [accolades](https://thegourmez.com/accolades/), including having the pleasure to judge wine and cooking competitions. Let’s call it a semi-professional involved hobby!

I like to think that my taste buds have matured after the last couple decades spent thinking way too hard about my food and drink. I also take pride in incorporating the nostalgic and sensory details of a great meal into my fiction writing. What’s a fantasy novel without a great feast, right?

I live in Alameda County in the Bay Area, and I get in a few great trips a year. You’ll find [chronicles of those here](https://thegourmez.com/categories/travelguides), too.

The East Bay is a fantastic home base for gorging myself on many amazing cuisines. But though it’s passé at this point, I do love fusion cooking the best.
