<h1>About the Gourmez</h1>

My name is Becca, nice to meet you! Trying to reach me? Email me at becca@thegourmez.com. Or follow me at these social media platforms: · Bluesky · Facebook · Instagram · Google Local Guides You’ll find my fiction under the name Rebecca Gomez Farrell, and my author website is here. Fiction writing is my primary career. The Gourmez is more of an involved hobby . . . a hobby that’s resulted in multiple media mentions and accolades [link to Accolades page], including having the pleasure to judge wine and cooking competitions. Let’s call it a semi-professional involved hobby!

I like to think that my taste buds have matured after the last couple decades spent thinking way too hard about my food and drink. I also take pride in incorporating the nostalgic and sensory details of a great meal into my fiction writing. What’s a fantasy novel without a great feast, right?

I live in Alameda County in the Bay Area, and I get in a few great trips a year. You’ll find chronicles of those [link to Travelogue search category] here, too.

The East Bay is a fantastic home base for gorging myself on many amazing cuisines. But though it’s passé at this point, I do love fusion cooking the best.
