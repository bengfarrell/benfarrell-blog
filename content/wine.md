<h1>Wine</h1>

I’ve been wine tasting for years now, but I like to think I approach it from the average consumer’s perspective. The average consumer can appreciate when a cabernet franc boasts deep flavors or that first effervescent sip of a vinho verde conjures up a delightful summertime memory. But more often than not, they just want an affordable glass of wine that tastes delicious while lounging by the TV. If it pairs well with that night’s barbequed ribs and garlic bread, that’s a plus!

Often, I prefer a nice, smooth red wine blend to a single varietal, but I do quite love floral notes and aromas and white wines with crisp acidity. I’ll try it all, though—there’s nothing I enjoy more than a surprise in my glass! My reviews may suggest a pairing for the wine I’m tasting if one comes to mind. Sometimes, I’ll share a particular memory or setting that the wine’s aromas and flavors remind me of, like rolling down a hillside as a kid or sitting on the porch, watching rain fall. But I’ll also share if I think it’s great on its own, no food required. And I do love finishing an evening with port or sherry for dessert.

After trying so many wines on wine tourism media trips, there’s little question for me that wines from smaller wineries often offer the best value. Those winemakers and owners have put a lot of time, effort, and heart into making a quality product, and because they aren’t that well-known, the wine is usually priced affordably. But let’s be real, a small winery may also mean a winemaker who’s still learning how to best approach the craft—nothing is a sure a bet. Which is why I am happy to help introduce you to ones I’ve already enjoyed! Hopefully, you will too.
