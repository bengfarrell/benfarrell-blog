This installation was a sound based one! We combined photos of the users of the installation with sound waves.
The sound waves were triggered by a MIDI keyboard and send to a speaker mounted near a thin layer of water. These visuals
would be combined to create the final output. We created this installation for the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego.
