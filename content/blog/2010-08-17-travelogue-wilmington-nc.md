It's been a while since I've had the chance to upload photos. I finally got to some yesterday, and thus, you must now see some of my faves from that trip here. For Ben's birthday in June we went to Wrightsville Beach, NC, which was pretty nice. The hotel we stayed at had great rooms; they were all separate apartments, essentially. It was actually fairly cheap for beach hotels in that area (read: still not cheap at all). It's called the Sand Peddler.

That doesn't mean I have pictures of the hotel, or the beach for that matter. Nope, all I took pictures of for that trip was of Wilmington by the Cape Fear River. We spent an afternoon there on their river walk.
