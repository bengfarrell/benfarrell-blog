Hello readers! On occasion, I learn about upcoming or ongoing food or drink events that I think may be of special interest to you and share them. This is one of those occasions! So grab the scheduling device of your choice and get on these opportunities to eat, drink, and maybe help a worthy local organization. Or just enjoy a good meal. Or both!

#### Girls Inc Party! With a Purpose

[![Girls Inc Party with a Purpose](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2016/09/A526C0CD-AB0B-4EF5-9865-2AAA841395B4-500x256.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2016/09/A526C0CD-AB0B-4EF5-9865-2AAA841395B4.png)

 

**What:** A dancing, drinking, and eating benefit for [Girls Inc. of the Island City,](http://www.girlsincislandcity.org/aboutus.php)  a nonprofit that has been empowering the girls of Alameda by providing developmental services since 1964.  As the description reads,

[For tickets, and more info, head here.](https://girlsincislandcity.ejoinme.org/MyEvents/PartywithaPurpose/tabid/789932/Default.aspx) Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the Party! With a Purpose, as I'll be giving [a reading at Liminal](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2016/09/september-appearances/) that night, but I hope you can attend and enjoy this exciting combination of enthusiasm for the Bay Area food and philanthropy scenes in one event.

#### Booze Comes to Brunch at the LunchPad SF!

[![The Lunchpad Logo](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2016/09/LunchPad.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2016/09/LunchPad.jpg)

**What:** Boozy brunch service on weekends at the Lunchpad, a shared space in Hayes Valley that the Hubbell brothers and co-owner Chris Snowdon have been using to make highly inventive sandwiches and breakfast items since 2013. Well, it's time for booze to enter the picture! The brunch menu, which expands on weekends from four to seven items, will now also feature bar service! A full bar is available, but look out for the Brunchpad Bloody in particular, which features the Lunchpad's  signature habanero candied bacon and homemade pickles.

**When:** Saturdays and Sundays, 11 am to 2:30 pm. Regular service, Monday through Friday, 9 am to 2:30 pm.

**Where:** The Noir Lounge, which the space converts to at night. 581 Hayes Street, San Francisco.

**Cost:** $6-$12

I'll be checking out some of their dishes at a media event next month, but there's no reason you can't get in on them now! [The Lunchpad has all their menus up on their website.](http://www.thelunchpadsf.com/) Heck, give me some suggestions for what I can't miss when I'm there.

Most of all, though, have a tasty September no matter where your food-loving heart takes you!
