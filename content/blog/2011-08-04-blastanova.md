A project still in progress.  Blastanova aims to combine music and games.  See [http://blastanova.com](http://blastanova.com) for more details. (update: sorry, this site was taken down)

To support the project, I created a website:

And business card:![blastanovabusinesscard](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/blastanovabusinesscard.jpg)

I also created and designed a music/beat scanning application in Flex:
