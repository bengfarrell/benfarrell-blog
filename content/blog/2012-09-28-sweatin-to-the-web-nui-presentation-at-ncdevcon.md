Hello!  If you're here, you might have come to my NUI (natural user interface) presentation at [NCDevCon](http://www.ncdevcon.com/).  NUI can mean anything from gesture input from your body, to speech control and anything that's natural and intuitive.

We went NUI vs GUI in my presentation and the hardware behind it.   We discovered how to develop with it using a few different Javascript solutions.  In this post I'd like to link to a few things from my presentation for easy reference.

**Early not really NUI hardware**

[Nintendo Power Pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pad)

[Dance Pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_pad)

[Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_hero)

**Getting NUI-ier**

[Nintendo Zapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Zapper)

[Playstation Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye)

[Wiimote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiimote)

[Playstation Move](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation_move)

I also made mention of the [Gamepad API for HTML5](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/games/an-introduction-to-the-html5-gamepad-api/).

Primarily we explored the [Kinect SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/) and [OpenNI](http://www.openni.org/) as the hardware support for the [Microsoft Kinect](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-L6M-00001-Kinect-Sensor-Windows/dp/B006UIS53K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1348801394&sr=8-3&keywords=Microsoft+Kinect) and [Asus Xtion Pro](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826785030).  We explored a few Javascript solutions for NUI:

- [DepthJS](https://github.com/doug/depthjs)
- [Kinesis.io](http://kinesis.io/)
- [KinectJS](http://kinect.childnodes.com/)

  
I also went into a few rules from the [Kinect for Windows Human Interface Guidelines](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/learn.aspx). Finally, I demoed a [KinectJS Kickstart](https://github.com/bengfarrell/KinectJSKickstart) I put together on Github, as well as my Kinect enabled music discovery project called [Blastanova](http://play.blastanova.com/kinect.html).   Here's my [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zX2ejz6vFK41S4jstNj8npbG8rB9JFm0mUVjDw-2bQI/edit) as well!  Have fun with this stuff, it's awesome!
