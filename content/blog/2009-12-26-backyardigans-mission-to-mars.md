Backyardigans: Mission to Mars was a CD-ROM game we created at 360KID. It featured several games for this Nickelodeon show that were strung together by cut-scenes to create a great story where the Backyardigans journey to Mars.

The game was comprised of several Flash modules (cut-scenes and games). Multidmedia's Zinc was used to package this as a desktop application.
