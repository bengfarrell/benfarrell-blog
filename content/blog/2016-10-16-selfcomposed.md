I was one of a few developers on this project. I definitely didn't lead it as MacOS development in Objective-C isn't
my forte, but I think I did lots with tying the print server to the UI and experience.

Self Composed was a project my team and I at Adobe did for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and stayed up through
around 2023.

Users could create unique compositions with the installation's 2 cameras where one view masked the other. So walking up, you'd
use whatever was in your pockets, place it on the table and create a selfie you could share.

Here's the [writeup](https://www.sfmoma.org/read/on-collaboration-sfmoma-adobe-rethink-selfie/) from the SFMOMA, but also we went on to win
a [Communication Arts Award](https://www.commarts.com/project/24685/self-composed).

*we made two installations, side by side (fabrication of the case, though was contracted out*
