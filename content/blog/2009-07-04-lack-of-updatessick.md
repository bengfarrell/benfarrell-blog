Hey guys, just letting you all know that I haven't been posting because I haven't had the energy to do much else other than play video games since I came down with the flu on Wednesday.  Summer flu is lame!  I will try to venture out for some festivities tonight but will not be surprised if I don't last long.

Hopefully, I will have new blogs up starting on Monday, assuming I am alive and well by then.  Have a fun holiday weekend, America!  Drink an extra one for me, will you?
