This educational CD-ROM was shipped with the Sabias Que text book as a supplement to teach the Spanish Language.  I engineered the entire project, and used XML data to make up the hundreds of questions, which required me to build a rendering engine to render these question from the XML.  Our navigation system was made in Flash and integrated with Director.
