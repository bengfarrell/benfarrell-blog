Just a quick note to let you all know that _the Gourmez_ will be on a bit of a hiatus. I'm going on a trip soon, and it'll take me some time to catch up again once I return, though you can expect several posts on the TerraVita food festival then! Hopefully, it'll only be a few weeks without new posts, but it could be up to a month. I'm sure you can find [plenty](http://www.greeneatsblog.com "Green Eats Blog") of [other](http://demandy.com/ "Demandy") [local](http://triangleexplorer.com/ "Triangle Explorer") [food](http://carpedurham.com "Carpe Durham") [bloggers](http://www.trianglelocalista.com "Triangle Localista") to help you pass the time until then! 'Til we meet again, salut!
