Cats Incredible Journey was a game created while I was at 360KID.  It focused on helping kids with emotions if I recall correctly.  In it's prototype phase, it was a Flash game with limited interaction and awesomely designed animated sequences.

The reason behind the interaction and gameplay being so limited and lightweight was so we could port it to a straight DVD which could be played on your standard set top player using the arrow keys and menu buttons to initiate actions.

The Flash sequences were rendered to Quicktime movies which I brought into DVD Studio Pro.  It was a pretty difficult to pull of, as I think I remember only being able to work with 6 variables throughout the entire application.

Was a frustrating thing to produce a DVD game, but we pulled it off!
