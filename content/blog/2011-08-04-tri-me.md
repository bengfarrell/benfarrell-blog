Back when I ran the Raleigh Durham Adobe User Group, I was a one man show.  I thought it would be a great idea to join forces with Adrian Pomilio who ran the local Flex User Group.  We came up with the name "Tri-Me" for Triangle Media Experience.

I came up with some logo concepts:

And then I comped up a webpage.  Adrian thought it was really ugly with the colors.  I actually still dig it.  Needless to say it was scrapped:
