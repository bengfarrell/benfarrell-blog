It's been a while since I've posted a round-up of upcoming foodie events and news for us Triangulars (yes, I have decided I like Triangulars best out of the options of what to call us residents of the NC Triangle). I've got a backlog of emails on tasty, delicious possibilities in the next few weeks, so it's definitely time to let you all know about them! Here we go:

[![Cookery Culinary Workshops](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/09/logo-150x150.jpg "logo")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/09/logo.jpg)The Cookery has launched [a series of culinary workshops](http://durhamcookery.com/culinary-workshops "List of Workshops") that are being led by a mix of locals, some professionals, some not. They cover a wide range of topics, including one tonight by Rue Cler's Chef de Cuisine, Aaron Benjamin, on shopping for meat locally and how to use everything the whole animal offers--sorry, it's sold out already! Other upcoming classes include the [Triangle Raw Foodists](http://trianglerawfoodists.com/wordpress/ "Vegan food delivery!") giving tips on how to create vegan sushi rolls (9/15) and Bull City Burger and Brew's Luke Studer showing us how to home brew all-grain beers (9/29, 10/1). Prices range from $40 to $65. Classes are small and look to be selling out fast, so jump on it if you want in on some hands-on cooking experiences with these fine folks.

They offer four flavors and over 30 toppings on the truck, and of course, it provides the same emphasis on local ingredients as their brick and mortar shop.

[![Bull City Burger and Brewery logo](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/09/Bull_City_Logo_web_1.png "Bull_City_Logo_web_1")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/09/Bull_City_Logo_web_1.png)Bull City Burger and Brewery's first Beefsteak Octoberfest is this next week, on 9/17, with seatings at 4 pm and at 6:30 pm. The fest lasts until midnight. Turns out that the German Oktoberfest starts in September, and BCBB is rolling with that. It will be a meat lovers' heaven with beef, offal, lamb, and sausage all supplied from NC farms. For the $45 ticket price, that meat is unlimited along with fries, radishes, celery, and bread and two beers. Live music will be playing all night, and BCBB's Octoberfest lager, Stierstadt (German for Bull City), will be premiered. [Get your tickets here](http://bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/BCB&B/Beefsteak_Octoberfest.html "Beefsteak Octoberfest tickets")! You must purchase them online before the event.

Tickets are $25 in advance per car or bike group, and $30 on the days of the event. For that price, your group can head out to any (or all!) of the 25 participating farms that open themselves up to showcase their sustainable practices and beautiful scenery, plants, and animals during this weekend. Bring a picnic! You can get [more information and tickets here](http://www.carolinafarmstewards.org/etft2011.shtml "More Info!").

It's 9/20 at 7 pm, and I will definitely be there! [RSVP her](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1181462787/mcivte "RSVP for Mojo's")e and meet other tw-eaters as we are called. ,)  These are totally relaxed dinner dates with a group of fellow food lovers.

TerraVita is a food and wine festival focused on promoting sustainable agriculture. Not only does it include the Grand Tasting with samples of food from North Carolinian chefs and organic wines from local and international distributors, but those wanting to learn more about the industry of providing sustainable food can participate in the sustainable classroom, learning about a range of topics from the people who work in this field every day. The Grand Tasting is $65, the sustainable classroom fee is $35, or you can participate in both for $90. Check out my blog on [last year's TerraVITA,](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=1691 "TerraVITA report") the very first, for more info on this experience.

Happy Eating!
