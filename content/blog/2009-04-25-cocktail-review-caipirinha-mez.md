[My Mez review](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2009-04-24-restaurant-review-mez-durham/)

Caipirinha is a great cocktail that a friend introduced me to a few years back.  It consists of limes muddled with sugar and cachaça, a rum-like Brazilian alcohol.  Mez's caipirinha has all these things but the proportions were a bit off to me.  I'd have liked more lime and less of the crunchy sugar, which might have had the added benefit of reducing the strong taste of the cachaça as well.  But those are small complaints.
