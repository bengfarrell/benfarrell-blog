As we at the [Sun Gallery](https://sungallery.org) push our makerspace forward, this is one of the activities I researched and
made. I used our Omtech 100W laser cutter/engraver to cut the pieces. The design on the box are simple vector art assets I pulled from
other things I drew previously. And the box, well that's pretty neat. You can customize the dimensions and create any size box at [makercase.com](http://www.makercase.com).
