There are two exciting events coming to downtown Durham this weekend. Unfortunately, I can’t make either of them, but I hope some of you can! First up is **Bright Lights, Bull City** on Saturday, 10/23, an event sponsored by _Durham Magazine_ to celebrate our vibrant downtown, Brightleaf, and West Village businesses. There will be live music at Alivia’s and free food and drink at several businesses including Fifi’s, Posh the Salon, and Magpie’s from 2 to 6 pm. Much like an art walk, this event is designed for you to make your way through downtown’s businesses, taking advantage of free munchies and the specials each participating business offers along the way. Such specials include 20% off coupons and free appetizers with the purchase of two entrees at the likes of Alivia’s, Pop’s, and 604 W. Morgan. Make sure you print out the coupons ahead of time from _Durham_ [_Mag’s blog post_](http://www.durhammag.com/blog/2010/10/1/this-is-gonna-be-huge.html) on the event.

The following afternoon, 10/24, swing by the Durham Arts Council for [**Yelp Helps!**](http://www.yelp.com/events/durham-yelp-helps) from 3 to 5 pm. Yelp is matching up a few of your favorite things (free food from the Picnic Basket, beer, music, magic, and art-perusing) with several Triangle-area nonprofits to help you learn about the local volunteer opportunities that best suit your interests. Due to that free beer deal, it’s 21 and older only, and you need to have a Yelp account to RSVP and attend, but joining up is easy [here](https://www.yelp.com/signup). There’s a long list of participating nonprofits including the Doughman, Scrap Exchange, Seesaw Studios, Southeast German Shepherd Rescue, and Genesis Home. Swing by and find out just how giving you feel after a few PBRs in your belly!

Have fun, Durham! I’ll be enjoying high tea with the Queen instead. Okay, probably fish and chips at a cheap stand, completely lost, but I’ll be thinking of you while I try to flag down a cab and hope I get the exchange rate right.
