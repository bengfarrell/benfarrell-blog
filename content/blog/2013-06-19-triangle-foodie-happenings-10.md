The exciting events for Triangle-based foodies are piling up yet again! Honestly, I'm not sure they ever stop piling—we seem to support an awful lot of delishness for a relatively small metro area. I think that means all us eaters deserve a round of applause ... or of digestives. Ouzo, anyone?

I've cherry-picked a few upcoming dinners and tastings for this week among the press releases I've come across. Here they are in order of soonest to latest:

**[![AndreaMoore-44](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2013/06/AndreaMoore-44-100x150.jpg)](http://www.thegourmez.com/2013/06/triangle-foodie-happenings-10/andreamoore-44/)Tonight at 6:30 pm**, [Antonia](http://www.antoniashillsborough.com/)'s in Hillsborough is hosting a five-course, family style, Italian meal including wine pairings and the very special entertainment of opera singer Andrea Edith Moore. Ms. Moore, a featured soprano with the North Carolina Opera, will perform select arias throughout the dinner. She "currently serves on the voice faculty at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She has performed with companies including the Hamburg Kammeroper, Central City Opera, Aspen Music Festival and the North Carolina Opera. Her most recent roles are Micaela in _Carmen_ and the Governess in _Turn of the Screw_. Among many honors, Moore has received the distinguished Yale School of Music alumni award twice."

Donatos's "golden crispy thin crust is legendary and when paired with the finest freshest toppings, the result is a pizza taste that you just can’t find anywhere else!" Donatos's signature is the Edge-to-Edge pizza, meaning the toppings cover every inch of every slice. [The menu is here](http://www.donatosraleigh.com/ "Donatos Website"), and Donatos offers delivery and limited in-house dining.
