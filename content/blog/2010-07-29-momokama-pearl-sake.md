**Momokawa Pearl Sake** Junmai Ginjo Nigori Genshu Oregon

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/pearlsake.jpg)

This sake is nigori, so it's unfiltered, and I'm happy to report that it doesn't taste like sour milk like the Snow Maiden nigori sake did. Instead, it's got a delicious creamy flavor of banana, breadfruit, and a bit of kiwi. There's a strong floral element also, which I'll dub lavender. Definitely enjoyable and I will drink it again, with pleasure.

Wow. This is amazingly gross. Starts ok, but has a strange metallic twinge at the end that spoils it.

We've tried several sakes and this one is one of the best. We first tried unfiltered sake at Benihana in Japantown (San Francisco) and loved it instantly. It has a cloudy appearance. It's sweet, creamy, full-bodied, and very yummy.

A beautiful, shimmering white color, the unfiltered sweet sake was soft and smooth with overtones of melon and apple. At 18% alcohol (where the others were 14.8%), the Pearl is no chic drink. It may be soft and sweet, but it packs a punch with about the same alcohol content as a ruby port. . . the Pearl was a velvety, sweet blanket covering our tongues . . . It was the perfect end to a wonderful meal.
