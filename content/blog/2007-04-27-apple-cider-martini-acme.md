**Acme**\
110 East Main Street\
Carrboro, NC

This one did not live up to my expectations. I was anticipating the same level of spice as a mug of apple cider, but Acme seems to have been aiming more for sparkling cider, which is really nothing more than extra fizzy apple juice. At least it wasn't of the sour apple vein that's so popular right now.

The alcohol flavor was non-existent but overall, the drink was very smooth and the pomengrate seeds at the bottom were an inspired touch. They made the journey to drink it all worth the effort.
