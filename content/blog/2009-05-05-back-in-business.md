Hello my faithful readers,

Sorry I have not been updating with as much frequency the past few weeks.  Apparently, having out-of-town visitors means I need to actually entertain them.  They don't want to sit and watch as I type on my keyboard all day...can you believe that?  To be fair, I never gave them the option, either.  Instead, there has been much downtown Raleigh and Durham visiting, Tarheel Championship paraphernalia hunting, pirate exhibitions, barbecue parties, cat playtime, and birthday trivia victories.

In exchange for jilting you, I will promise to post at least one item every day until...I run out of things to post.  That'll probably be next week sometime.  =)  In the meantime, please enjoy the extra restaurant, wine, and cocktail reviews and hopefully, I will also get some pictures up of our adventures these past few weeks.

Thanks for reading!
