Here's another project I worked on, but almost 20 years later I don't remember much about. Here's a snippet from
the 360KID portfolio website about this project:

*Like many children, Cactus Cal is having trouble staying dry at night. To keep him from flooding the desert during the night, his friends assist him in creating a personalized Dry as a Desert Plan. 360KID created the characters, storyline, user interface, and carnival games for the Dry2Night program. It was designed to meet the needs of both parents and child to help them to understand the physical and emotional causes of bedwetting. The website contains nine Flash games, holds a large back-end database, and allows for a personal and unique experience for each user, parent or child.*
