RTE is a tech related talk show on Codebass Radio hosted by Adrian Pomilio, Dustin Graham, and yours truly.  We take our (guessing here) around 40 years of combined development experience and talk about new tools, languages, tech, and more.  Recent events, tech we're messing around with, comics, TV - whatever is relevant that day.

We broadcast live on Codebass and Google+.  You can catch us at [runtimeexpectations.com](http://runtimeexpectations.com)
