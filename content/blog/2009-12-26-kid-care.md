We did this grant based project for a company called Inflexxion through my then employer 360KID. Â The project was an interactive story that took kids through several playable missions to help them deal with all the emotions and troubles that come with having a divorce in their family.

There were many walkthroughs and interactive tutorials, a journal they could write in, and more.

The project was done with Flash and divided into many modules as the user explored and went through missions.
