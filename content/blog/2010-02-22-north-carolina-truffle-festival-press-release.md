I received a press release for another fun foodie event for North Carolinians and am sharing in case any of you are interested. It's being held at the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Asheville, which is getting rave reviews, and is sponsored by the Frankie Lemmon Foundation. What is it? A truffle hunt and celebration! Doing a truffle hunt sounds way fun, but I must admit, I haven't been sold on the flavor prowess of the truffle yet myself. Yes, I'm averse to fungi, but that's not the problem for me here--I just haven't tasted what truffle adds to the party. I think I might need to do a comparison sometime, try a dish without truffle then try one with it and see if I can tell the difference. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm going to find a restaurant willing to make me two dishes for the price of one for this experiment! Tell me what you think truffle adds in the comments. And go truffle hunting this weekend if you can swing it!

Satisfy your culinary cravings by celebrating an earthy treasure, the Truffle.  Truffles, described as "diamonds of the kitchen", are a type of mushroom grown underground and known for their powerful taste. For one sumptuous weekend only, award-winning chefs and outstanding winemakers pair up to honor the exquisite and highly prized delicacy.Guests will indulge in sumptuous truffle dishes, take part in cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, and even a truffle-dog hunting course. The first people to book their stay get special access to watch top chefs, including John Currence, the James Beard Foundation's "Best Chef South" 2009 award-winner, compete to showcase truffles in their most decadent risotto dish.

This festival, perfect for gourmet food and wine lovers, takes place just steps away from the famous Biltmore Estate, at the Grand Bohemian Hotel, in charming Asheville, NC.
