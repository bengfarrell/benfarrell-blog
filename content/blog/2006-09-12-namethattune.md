When Amazon offers 30 second samples of music to buy, can you make a game out of it!
Yes! I had an idea for a "Name that Tune!" party game where you could use Amazon's API and
entire music catalog in a desktop built Flash application.

This was just a fun experiment I made myself, and we played it at a get together I had with friends.
