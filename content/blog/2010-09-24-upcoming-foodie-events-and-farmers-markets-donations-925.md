Apologies for the lack of posts this week---I was in DC! Which, of course, means a travelogue is in the works, and several other posts are close to ready, including one on the Cruzan 9 event at the Busy Bee last week. There are lots of exciting foodie events coming up in the next few weeks, so yay us! I'll be headed to the first ever [Social Media Supper Club](http://smsc.eventbrite.com/) next Thursday (9/30) at 7, which is really an excuse for me to finally meet [Demandy](http://demandy.com/), and hang with [Brian C.](http://amplifyinggood.wordpress.com/) again, a blogger new to the area from Colorado. We decided to try out [David's Dumpling and Noodle Bar](http://www.ddandnb.com/). It's totally low key: we just picked a place and a time and are showing up that evening with a small group (20 tops, I think) to eat together, giving the restaurant a head's up on the larger than normal group. Sign up at the website!

Also, don't forget about the [TerraVita](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=1550) event at Southern Village coming up on 10/16 that will highlight organic and sustainable foods and drinks from the Southeast and beyond or the next [Triangle Foodie Tweetup](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/856571027/autohome) at Lucky 32 on 10/7. Yelp is putting on what looks to be a fabulous event, [the Pop Culture Palooza,](http://www.yelp.com/events/raleigh-yelps-pop-culture-palooza) the next evening, featuring all sorts of craziness, including burlesque, celebrity impersonators, and of course, eats and drinks to keep us all happy. Somehow, I think I'll be making all three of those events!

And finally, the [Bull City Vegan Challenge](http://carpedurham.com/2010/08/18/the-bull-city-vegan-challenge-in-october/) is gearing up, which is your chance to try out vegan entries concocted by Durham's chefs and vote for the best throughout October--none of those portabella sandwiches or veggie burgers allowed!

One last item to note: If you head to the Durham, Carrboro, South Estes, or Western Wake farmers' markets tomorrow, make sure to buy some extra fresh produce for [Urban Ministries Community Cafe's](http://www.umdurham.org/what-we-do/cafe.html) drive to get 4,000 pounds of food donations in 4 hours at 4 markets. Each market will have a donation station to collect the extra food you can buy to help them feed whomever needs a meal with fresh, healthy fare.
