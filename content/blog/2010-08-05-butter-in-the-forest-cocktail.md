**Butter in the Forest** Adapted from _Japanese Cocktails_ by Yuri Kato

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/butterforest.jpg)

1/4 avocado 1 tsp honey 2 shots junmai nigori sake 3/4 shot vodka 1/4 shot triple sec 1 shot almond milk

I made this drink from a sake cocktail recipe in order to use up less than a glass of sake. I had to alter ingredients due to what I had available; I used a combo of vodka and triple secÂ  rather than citrus vodka, guesstimated the amount of honey (getting a measuring spoon all sticky is totally not worth it) and used almond milk rather than soy. With all that, it probably needs a new title, but my creativity juice is zapped.

Muddle together the avocado and honey until the avocado is very mashed. Add the rest of the ingredients and shake. Strain into a chilled martini glass. Make sure that glass is chilled for this drink.

Have I mentioned how much I love avocado? That love extends to this cocktail, though it may have something to do with the amount of honey I poured into it. The avocado compounds in richness when combined with the creamy sake and almond milk. It's a drink that makes you feel upper crust as you revel in it. Drinks with texture are fun. The only complaint I have is that there's a bit too much of an alcohol kick-the sake is 18% ABV after all and you can taste it in this.
