While at 360KID, we created a interactive CD-ROM for the Discovery Channel.  The aim was to create a series of modules for kids to explore various scientific topics.

I didn't have a huge part in this project - it was mostly maintenance as I came in at the end, but I did develop one of the 20 interactive modules - which was a cost/benefit activity for heating  and cooling a home.
