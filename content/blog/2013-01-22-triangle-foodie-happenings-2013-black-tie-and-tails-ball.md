About a year and a half ago, [I visited](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2011/04/carolina-tiger-rescue/ "Visit blog") the the [Carolina Tiger Rescue](http://www.carolinatigerrescue.org/default.asp "Website") in Pittsboro. They are an excellent nonprofit organization that provides homes for big cats that have been abandoned or abused, whether they are reclaimed from a zoo or given up by owners who can no longer care for the exotic creatures. Tigers, lions, lynx -- it doesn't matter what species of big cat. The Carolina Tiger Rescue tends to them all, and they have never been busier, often unable to take in new animals because their cages are full.

_That's great, the Gourmez_, you may be saying, _but what does this have to do with food_? Well, it's nearly time for the Carolina Tiger Rescue's annual fundraiser, and it is of definite interest to area foodies.

The Black Tie and Tails Ball will be held on 2/23 from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm at the Washington Duke Inn, and if you know me, you know I love the food by Chef Jason Cunningham. The theme this year is the Many Faces of Thailand, and the menu is as follows:

I don't know about you, but I'm salivating reading that list. It sounds amazing! In addition to dinner, there will be both live and silent auctions including vacations and wine and dine packages. Now, this is a fundraiser, so it's not cheap. Early bird prices are $110, then tickets rise to $125 after 1/31. But honestly, for a phenomenal dinner and fundraising? That's not so bad. If you're interested, get your tickets [here](http://www.carolinatigerrescue.org/events/BTTB/default.asp "tickets for black ties and tails ball"). I'm not sure I'll make it yet, but I sure hope I can.
