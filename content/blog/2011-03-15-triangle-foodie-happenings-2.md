I've got another update on Triangle-area foodie happenings for you! First, the lovely Morgan Siem, whom I first met at last month's [Social Media Supper Club](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=2299), is putting on a fundraising dinner at [Vespa Ristorante](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/restaurants/review.php?id=21&type=) in Chapel Hill on Wednesday, 3/30, at 7 pm.  $15 from the $44 meal will go directly to St. Baldrick's Hospital to promote research on children's cancers. Here's the menu:

> First Course,  Family Style: Calamari Fritti, Fried Calamari served with Marinara and Fried Zucchini, and  Mediterranean Mezze Platter, a Mediterranean sampling of Hummus, Olive Tapenade, Acili Ezme, and Eggplant Caviar.
> 
> Second Course, choice of  Fettuccini Primavera, homemade fettuccini served with seasonal vegetables in a light tomato sauce;  Agnello, lamb shank stewed in a red wine sauce and served over turmeric risotto; or Salmon en Crosta, salmon baked in a philo dough shell stuffed with feta and caramelized onions and served on a bed of wilted spinach in a light tomato broth and topped with carp roe aioli.
> 
> Dolce, a family style dolce platter.

Various prizes will also be raffled off. Reserve your tickets through Eventbrite [here](http://vespa-st-baldricks-zvents.eventbrite.com/).

Next, Sara Foster, owner and chef of the local [Foster's Market](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=2119) chain, is doing a cookbook signing at the Regulator in Durham on 4/7 at 7 pm. Her new cookbook is called _Sara Foster's Southern Kitchen: Soulful, Traditional, Seasonal_. She'll be reading from it, signing books, and holding a tasting. The press release describes the book thusly: Foster's definitive southern cookbook serves up dozens of contemporary interpretations of classic dishes.  She also shares tips to ensure that dishes will turn out perfect every time---from the secret to fluffy buttermilk biscuits to ideas for swapping out ingredients to accommodate any season, from hints on how to fry up chicken like a true southerner to barbeque fundamentals that can put any home cook on par with a southern pitmaster.

Last, Craig Heffley, owner of [Wine Authorities](http://www.wineauthorities.com/home.php), is providing the wine pairings for a springtime tea luncheon for the James Beard Foundation on 4/10 at 12 pm. While the luncheon is being held in NYC at the James Beard House, I'm mentioning it because it's a great honor for Craig! He is working with his friend, the Artist Baker Andrea Lekberg. Per Andrea's email, both she and Craig worked together in Durham early on in their art and food careers. She later moved to NJ and opened the Artist Baker there while Craig stayed in Durham, opening Wine Authorities with his then-partner Seth Gross. Craig will also be taking on the hosting duties during the luncheon. You can read the full menu and purchase tickets if you are interested and plan to be in NYC [here.](http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=events_beardhouse_lunch_041011)
