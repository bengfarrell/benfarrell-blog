The Hot Guava is a margarita made from guava juice, jalapenos, tequila, and lime. The jalapeno was bright and powerful from the first sip, but I think that was the problem---all you could taste was that sweet heat and a little bit of sourness. It cancelled out the guava flavor entirely for me.

Now, I love spice, so I drank this happily, but it's definitely not the best jalapeno cocktail I've had. [The Sting](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2009/08/17/cocktail-review-the-sting-at-the-hive-raleigh/) at the Hive gets that honor.
