I work at a great little (getting bigger, so I don't know I can even say that anymore) startup called Digitalsmiths in Downtown Durham, NC at the American Tobacco Campus.  Digitalsmiths is the industry leader in video search, discovery, and recommendations.  We power many TV/movie experiences for studios, websites, and other emerging markets.

Personally, I'm one of our elite UI developers who occasionally get turned on the server side.  Given the spread of our market and clients, we get to work with Javascript, Flash, HTML5, Android, iOS, and more.  It's a pretty nifty gig for those bold enough to take on whatever direction the market turns this week.

*Update from 2024: Digitalsmiths was aquired by TiVo and the website isn't around anymore*
