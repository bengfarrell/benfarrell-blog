I don't often post press releases at _the Gourmez_, but sometimes, I think there's a really unique experience or deal that some of my readers will enjoy hearing about. I have a pair of those today! Yes, these are intended for food lovers with a budget that allows extravagance and if that's you....take me with you! 😆 Or just take advantage of these potentially amazing experiences. I'm copying the press releases below:

##### 1\. Abalone Lover? Here's your adventure!

> **_–_** The Little River Inn is pleased to announce their third annual **_ABALONE CAMP_**, a unique undersea and oversea adventure, available to guests in June 2017. The family-owned and operated inn has partnered with Triton X/Freedive Shop, local freedive experts, to offer this two-day Abalone experience during Northern California’s peak Abalone Season.

**2\. Learn (and Eat!) Global Cuisine from Star Chefs in Half Moon Bay**

I'm a little late sharing this opportunity, as the first two in the series have already passed...but never fear! There are 6 weekends' worth of the Global Cuisine Series left this year.  The release:

> Beginning in May 2017, [The Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/california/half-moon-bay) -- an elite destination resort located on the dramatic bluffs of the Northern California Coast -- will host the [Global Cuisine Series](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/california/half-moon-bay/dining/global-cuisine-series), featuring some of the most influential and accomplished chefs in California. For eight weekends starting at the end of May, the crème de le crème of California’s culinary world will present an immersive experience to a select group of guests while highlighting their own fresh take on the cuisine of different regions from around the world.

> 
> Each month, Maître Cuisinier de France Xavier Salomon, the hotel’s Executive Chef, has invited a different chef to the property to lead a unique gastronomical adventure. Together with Chef Jason Pringle of the hotel’s Navio restaurant, the visiting chef will helm an exploration of the distinctive global cuisine they have mastered.
> 
> The weekend begins with a hands-on cooking class led by the visiting chef, where guests assist in preparing a variety of dishes. Guests will then enjoy the fruits of their labor at a luncheon showcasing their preparations, which will be accompanied by wine pairings from the global destination the cuisine hails from. The visiting chef will also present two dishes on the Navio tasting menu for Saturday night, and will have a dedicated pop-up station at the hotel’s renowned Sunday Brunch.
