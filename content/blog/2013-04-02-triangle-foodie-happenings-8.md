Here's a trio of interesting going-ons in the Triangle foodie world. Two to perhaps attend, and one to be aware of, if you're intrigued by our food-friendly community.

**Sola's First Anniversary, 4/5 & 4/6, all day.**

[Sola Coffee Cafe](http://solacoffee.com/ "Sola Coffee") is having an exciting anniversary celebration with chances to win donuts for a year! Who could say no to that? Per their press release:

"Sola Coffee Café is celebrating its 1-year mark by donating $1.00 from every sale of a dozen Hot Mini donuts the weekend of April 6th and giving away a dozen free Hot Mini Donuts a day for a year to two lucky winners.

The promotion runs all day Friday and Saturday. Live music both nights and during the day on Saturday. Counter Culture Coffee guru, Lem Butler, will oversee a “Coffees from Around the World” tasting on Friday afternoon from 1-3pm."

**Cooks & Books Dinner with Nancie McDermott, 4/11, 6 pm at the Granary**

The Fearrington House restaurant and McIntyre Books launched a Cooks & Books series of dinners a few years back, pairing visiting cookbook authors with a dinner that highlights their wares. The next one features a Triangle resident cookbook author rather than a touring one,  local favorite and a friend of mine, Nancie McDermott. The theme is a Thai New Year's Feast, and Chef Bedford has put together this fantastic menu with Nancie's input:

> _First Course_ Crispy Spring Rolls with Sweet-Hot Garlic Sauce / boh biah tote & nahm jeem gratiem Savory Minced Pork on Fresh Pineapple / mah haw Pink Grapefruit Salad with Toasted Coconut and Fresh Mint / yum som oh Issahn-Style Pork Salad with Toasted Rice and Fresh Mint / lahp moo
> 
> _Second Course_ Son-in-Law Eggs / kai leuk koey
> 
> _Main Course_ Jasmine Rice / kao hohm mali Panaeng Beef with Wild Lime Leaves and Coconut Cream / panaeng neua Crispy Rice Noodles with Pork, Shrimp, and Bean Sprouts / mee grop Chicken Coconut Soup / tome kha gai Spinach Stir-Fried with Black Pepper and Garlic / pahk boong fai daeng Tangy Cucumber Salad / taeng kwa dong
> 
> _Dessert_ Coconut & Lemongrass Custard with Mango Sorbet, Pineapple & Tamarind

Four courses with multiple dishes, an autographed copy of Nancie's _Real Thai_ cookbook, beverage pairings, tax, and gratuity all come to $100, which isn't bad for dinner with the author and all that!

 **Starting Fresh, a Durham-based, local food cookbook project**

Lastly, I wanted to make sure you were all aware of the seasonal cookbook, _Starting Fresh_, that Elizabeth Turnbull of Old Havana Sandwich Shop and Ali Rudel of This & That Jam are creating. Elizabeth described its mission as "The cookbook seeks to tell the story of how Durham, a former Tobacco Town, has found redemption in food, while teaching people to cook with local ingredients (of course!)." They've been hitting up a bunch of area food leaders, whether in coffee or the kitchen, and are posting progress updates  as they go at the [Starting Fresh blog](http://startingfreshrecipes.com/sf/ "Starting Fresh blog"). Make sure to check it out to keep your pulse on the local food scene! The beautiful photography is worth a peek on its own.

There are, of course, a great deal more happenings in the area. In fact, I think I'll be at [Cackalacky Night at the Broad Street Cafe](http://thebroadstreetcafe.com/events/cackalacky-night/ "Cackalacky Night") this Saturday to finally give that FullSteam-Cackalacky Ginger Pale Ale a try. Let me know if you go to any tasty events of your own!
