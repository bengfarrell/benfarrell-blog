Like many of these heavily animated and interactive games, Magic Numbers was developed while working for 360KID.
If I did a better job of keeping track of my work, I could say more about my role in developing this, but for now, I'll
copy the description from the 360KID portfolio website:

**When conceiving this math and number sense game, Sesame Workshop decided to bring back an old favorite character from yesteryear who hadn't been visited for a while: Mumford the Magician.

While Mumford was a perfect character to help host a game about counting and simple math, it did present a special challenge: no official digital line art version of Mumford had ever been created. Using style guide assets for other Sesame Street characters as reference for lines and shapes, the 360KID team was able to create a digital version of Mumford that sits easily beside characters whose 2D animated looks were previously well defined.

On top of that, the game itself is a huge hit.**
