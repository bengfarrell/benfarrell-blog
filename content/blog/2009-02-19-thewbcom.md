Just writing a short post to tout theWB.com which went live today after a makeover.  My new team and I at Digitalsmiths produced the video players and the clip search tool.  After just cancelling cable, I can't argue with even better video sites putting out great content.  I'm always a fan of Buffy and Angel which they have plenty of.  Everyone should also definitely check out the short WB shows "Joni and Susanna" and "Children's Hospital" starring Rob Cordry.  Someday soon I'll definitely check out "Babylon 5", but I don't know if I have enough geek cred yet.
