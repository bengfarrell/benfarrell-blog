My first official job after school was at a awesome company called Juniornet. Think America Online
but for kids! We had all sorts of activities for kids even including kids email.

This project I worked on was allowing kids to make and share movies, by dragging and dropping
pre-made assets on their stage, selecting a background and recording the assets moving.
