Hey everyone,

I just gave a Pixel Bender presentation at our local Adobe User Group yesterday. Â Here's a roundup of the blog posts I wrote as I was collecting my thoughts:

First I wrote about the problems I wanted to solve, and why Pixel Bender seemed like the right choice:

Next, an overview and intro of Pixel Bender:

And then, a post about using Pixel Bender for data instead of images:

Finally, some speed tests along with a sample application I wrote to run the speed tests:
