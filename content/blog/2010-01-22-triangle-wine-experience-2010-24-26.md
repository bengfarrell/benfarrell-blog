Sarah Findle, with the Frankie Lemmon Foundation, sent me an e-mail to let me know about the Triangle Wine Experience 2010, thinking it would be an event right up my alley. She was right! Unfortunately, I'm going to be out of town that weekend, so you all need to go and enjoy yourselves on my behalf.

Sarah shared that "Funds raised by the Triangle Wine Experience support the Frankie Lemmon School and Developmental Center, a non-profit preschool for children with special education needs. This tuition-free developmental center serves children ages 3-6 who have developmental delays, language impairments, learning disabilities, or mental retardation."

Drink wine and support a good cause? You can't beat that. My friends over at _Triangle Vino_ have a detailed breakdown of the events at TWE 2010, so head on over there [to check it out](http://trianglevino.com/2010/01/triangle-wine-experience-2010/). Let me know if you attend and enjoy it, so I can keep it in mind for next year.
