**French Kiss Martini** City Beverage 4810 Hope Valley Road Durham, NC

This libation is a mix of vodka, chambord, pineapple, and lemon peel. It's a slightly different recipe than the classic French Kiss but tastes just like that standard---a favorable level of sweetness, but overall, somewhat dull. Brightly deep red in color but the taste did not linger.
