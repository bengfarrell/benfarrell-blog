This was a marketing CD-ROM for a Phillips product called Intellivue - a networked system of patient monitoring systems.  I did the Director engineering work, and integrated the user interface with Flash assets produced by the artists.  There were several pre-rendered rotating 3D products, and several high quality videos.
