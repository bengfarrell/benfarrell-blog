This was a project I freelanced on. It was a marketing CD-ROM for a patient monitor.
It was fairly standard fare for a medical device marketing CD-ROM. I do remember we had the
challenge of a 360 degree rotating view of the monitor. We rendered tons of transparent pngs
and then the mouse interaction flipped through them as though it was a 3D scene. 3D wasn't
so amazing and realistic at the time, and we really wanted to show off the product.
