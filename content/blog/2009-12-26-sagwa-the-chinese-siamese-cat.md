We at 360KID did a few games for PBS Kids with Sagwa.  We did two similar style games.  Counting Koi was a simple counting games where kids would count fish in a pond, and Exploring the Palace was mostly a click and explore type of game.

The logic and gameplay in these games aren't incredibly difficult - though weaving animation/dialog clips together and fitting a particular narrative for the infinite number of possibilities can be hard.  We did get it down to a science at 360KID for these click and explore games with characters that guide you through the experience.
