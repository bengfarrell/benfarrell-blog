The SharkAttack (yeah!) started out as a radio show on Codebass Radio.  It started out as an Adobe AIR based tool to CREATE the radio show.  Since then, I've flipped the project around and turned it into a service that runs on Node.js.  It still powers the radio show called SharkAttack, but it also powers my music discovery website at [Blastanova.com](http://Blastanova.com).

The SharkAttack service gathers up music from blogs all over the internet, downloads them, converts the videos to MP3, and packages them up as a playlist to play every Wednesday at 1pm EST on [CodebassRadio.net](http://CodebassRadio.net).

It's coming along pretty nicely, and I've done 50+ shows with it so far - and I'm always improving.  Who knows, maybe someday I'll make it available for general use!
