This is just a short post - mainly for myself to remind me of the opensource awesomeness that was just released. It's called Cocoon P2P.

What this project appears to be is a peer to peer helper application for Flash powered devices to communicate in the same network. So basically, if I have a Android phone, a laptop, and an Android tablet all running Flash on my wi-fi network, they can talk to each other - without a server!

It sounds fantastic, and available at http://code.google.com/p/cocoon-p2p/. The source code doesn't look that hefty either, so yay for easy to understanding!
