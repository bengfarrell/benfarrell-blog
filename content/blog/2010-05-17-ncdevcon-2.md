Just wanted to post a quick update that I'll be speaking at NCDevCon with a hands on Flex 4 session on Saturday with Adrian Pomilio, and then on Sunday with a Flash Audio session. Adrian and I will also be pushing our new group Tri-Me! Check out ncdevcon.com for more info on the conference! It's a great free CF, Flash, Flex, and Web conference in Raleigh
