My first "mobile" project!  This was before Android, before iOS....

It was on the Pocket PCs back in the early 2000's.  We were doing a stylus based Flash project for Highlights magazine on the smartphone-like pocket organizer.  We ran Flash with a wrapper program called "Ant" which was designed to run on Windows CE.

The mobile app was designed to be the interactive version of Highlights Hidden Pictures, where the illustration hid several objects that the user was supposed to find.
