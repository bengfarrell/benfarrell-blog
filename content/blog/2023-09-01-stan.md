As a board member of the [Sun Gallery](https://sungallery.org), we're always looking for unique ways to make art and promote
the gallery. Carla Dozier, the board president, had the idea to create a mascot for the gallery and drew up a rough sketch of Stan the Sun. I took that sketch and created a digital version of Stan, the Octopus.

Once the digital version was complete, we used it in various places, but most importantly, Carla took my digital reference and
painted a matching mural on the walls of the makerspace. I painted a bit, but my skills are all digital, and I was afraid I was screwing it up, so didn't do much!

Later, I went on to use a digital capture of the physical mural in designing some Stan stickers.
