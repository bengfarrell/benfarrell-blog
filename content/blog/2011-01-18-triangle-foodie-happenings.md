Press releases are running rampant lately! Triangle Restaurant Week is nearly here, and we've both a huge wine event coming up in February and the opening of a new butcher's shop in April. First up, dining!

> The 4th Triangle Restaurant Week will run from 1/24 to 1/30, which has moved up to January from March to coincide with the restaurant weeks held in major metropolitan areas throughout the country. There are more than 60 restaurants participating this year, which is amazing! Each spot offers three course meals for lunch or dinner at a low price: $15 for lunch and $20 to $30 for dinner, depending on the venue. Prices do not include beverages, taxes, or tips. For the lineup of participating restaurants, head to their [website](http://www.trirestaurantweek.com/). Honestly, folks, it's worth checking out the site just for the promotional videos---love that cheesy, dramatic music!
> 
> Additionally, a drawing will be held for $1500---yes, you read that right!---for everyone who joins their [Facebook fan page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Triangle-Restaurant-Week/309606785049) by 1/30. In fact, I'm headed over now . . .

Next up, wine!

> The [Triangle Wine Experience](http://www.trianglewineexperience.org/) is an annual event that raises money for the Frankie Lemmon Foundation. Head to their website to register for any or all of the events. Here's what they have in the works:
> 
> **Thursday, February 3, 7:00 p.m. – Wine Maker Dinners**
> 
> Hosted by winemakers and winery owners from all over the country, this evening pairs some of the Triangle’s hottest restaurants with the world’s finest wines. Attendees will be able to choose from 30 amazing pairings of the finest wines with cuisines designed to compliment. It's $125 per person, and there's quite the list of restaurants to choose from.
> 
> **Saturday, February 5, 1:00—3:00 p.m. – Sip, Shop, & Sign**
> 
> Local retail shops will host participating wine makers/winery owners to sample their wines so customers can taste, buy, and have their bottle signed. No registration needed, just show up at participating stores to try some wine!
> 
> **Saturday, February 5, 5:30 p.m. – Grand Gala and Auction**
> 
> Two spirited auctions, live and silent, provide you the opportunity to bid on spectacular wines, exotic trips, unique dining experiences, fine art, and grand-format tastings all specifically created for The Triangle Wine Experience. The auction is followed by a grand gala with dancing, drinks, and dessert. This event is black tie. It' also $150.

And finally, meat!

> In April, Craig and Derek Wilkins are opening a second branch of [the Meat Hous](http://www.themeathouse.com/)e, a franchise butchery that specializes, obviously, in butchery, but also in wines, cheeses, and other gourmet products with at least 30% of their offerings from local producers. The Wilkins's first shop, opened in Cary last year, must be doing well! The Meat House has all your standard meats available, but they also are willing to seek out more exotic fare like buffalo, ostrich, and gator if you give them some notice. The new store will be on Falls of Neuse in Raleigh. It looks like a location may be opening in Chapel Hill on Franklin Street soon, too.

Enjoy!
