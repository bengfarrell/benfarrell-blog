Refresh the Triangle is the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill chapter of [Refreshing Cities](http://refreshingcities.com/).  I co-organize the group with several awesome folks.  We organize meetups that focus on web technologies and practices, covering design, development, project management, and others.

You can find us on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/refreshthetriangle/)
