Due out in Summer 2019, Manning Publications is releasing my first book. [_Web Components in Action_](https://www.manning.com/books/web-components-in-action)Â walks readers through the basics of creating their own custom elements, using template literals stored in modules to properly separate your HTML/CSS, and the ins and outs of the Shadow DOM. The book runs through lots of hands on examples, as well as build steps, testing and strategies to accommodate older browsers.
