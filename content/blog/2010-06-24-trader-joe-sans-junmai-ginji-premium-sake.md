I haven't developed a sake nose yet, because I can only say that Trader Joe-San's sake smells like . . . sake. It tastes clean and crisp, and of rice, of course, but it's also densely creamy, without actually being an unfiltered sake. It's like drinking toasted marshmallow cream but with only a mild sweetness and a fleeting hint of banana. I really like it.

The scent is very pleasant, yeasty, and full of butterscotch. Taste is light and earthy, no fruits or sweetness at all.
