NCDevCon is an awesome annual conference in Raleigh, NC.  It focuses on Flash, Flex, Coldfusion, Web, and Mobile.

The organizers had asked me to help design a logo.  I came up with a black and white concept for them, and ended up stopping there since they wanted a simple black and white webpage and something to print on t-shirts and marketing material.

It came out extremely simply, but I think everyone likes it. Its interesting to hear people's takes on what the logo symbolizes.  With so many technologies in one conference, how to symbolize them all?  I chose to go for something that symbolized an open, new document.  Like the icon you see when choosing blank/new document from a menu (where the corner of the page is turned in).

Anyway, I did that - but I heard that it did a good job to represent the Raleigh skyline.  I think the best logos are simple and can be interpreted however the viewer sees them.

Below are some more sketches I did before landing on the final
