I *think* I mainly just architected the framework and developed the main menu container app for this project. Another one that I'm documenting now and can't remember much
all these years later. Here's a snippet from the 360KID (the agency I worked for) portfolio website about this project:

*Pokemon Learning League*

*The Pokemon Learning League is a web-based series of standards-driven, interactive, and animated lessons for children in grades three through six. Working off of initial scripts, 360KID was responsible for storyboarding, animating, and programming 140 different lessons. Each lesson consists of several minutes of animation that perfectly blends educational content with one of the world's most recognized brands, explaining each concept in the style of a mini episode, followed by two interactive sequences where children can be tested on their comprehension.*

*Pokemon Learning League went on to receive wide recognition, including:*

 - 2008 SIIA CODIE Award for Best Instructional Solution for Students at Home
 - 2008 SIIA CODIE Award Finalist for the Best K-12 Instructional Solution
 - 2007 AEP Distinguished Achievement Award for K5 Science Instruction
 - 2007 BESSIE Award in the category of Multi-Subject Website for Upper Elementary
 - iParenting Media Awards Outstanding Products of 2007 Website Winner
 - 14th Annual Teachers' Choice Awards for the Classroom
 - Learning Center's 12th Annual Education Software Review Awards
 - The National Parenting Center's Seal of Approval
