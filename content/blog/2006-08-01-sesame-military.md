Usually doing Flash work in these days, this was the rare website I did all in HTML/CSS/JS.
As it was 2006, it was all table based layouts, and with the weird non-rectangular shapes, it was a lot of
detailed work to get it looking right.

The site was for kids of military families to help them understand and cope with the deployment of a parent.
