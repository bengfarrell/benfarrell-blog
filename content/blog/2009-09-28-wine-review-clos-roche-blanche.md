**Region:** Touraine, Loire Valley, France

This rose is full of berry on the nose that disappears when you drink it.  In the berry's place, there's a citrus flavor that tastes like Fresca, except it's more pungent yet also more grounded.  It's a velvety wine that is quirky, bright, and stony.  I don't particularly like Fresca; I love this.
