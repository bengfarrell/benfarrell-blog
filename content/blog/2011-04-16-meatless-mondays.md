Eleni Vachos, of [Bull City Vegan Challenge](http://bullcityveganchallenge.com/), is launching another endeavor to move Bull City residents toward meatless eats, at least one day a week. As part of the national movement, she has created [Triangle Meatless Mondays](http://www.trianglemm.com) and is encouraging restaurants to commit to offering a vegan item and eaters to pledge to abstain from meat on Mondays to promote healthier amounts of meat consumption and a more sustainable food system. The official launch of Triangle Meatless Mondays is on Earth Day, 4/22.

The participating restaurants so far are Pie Pushers, Pomegranate Kitchen (Chapel Hill), and Moe's Southwest Grill for Durham; Vimala's Curryblossom Cafe and the Pig for Chapel Hill; and Spring Rolls and Moe's Southwest Grill for Raleigh. If you're a restaurant owner and interested or a consumer and you'd like to make the pledge, then head on out [to Triangle Meatless Mondays](http://www.trianglemm.com/) to find the full list of participating locations and great recipe ideas.
