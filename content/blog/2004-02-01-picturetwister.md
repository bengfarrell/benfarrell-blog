I don't think this was tied to a particular client, but it was a fun little proof of concept.
Remember, this was around 2004 - so mobile was pretty much non-existent. Yet, we made a mobile game for the Pocket PC!
It was made in Flash then dropped on the device to work with the stylus. Its a simple game where you move the pieces of a scrambled picture
into place.
