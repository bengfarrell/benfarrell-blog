The title of this blog post is ALSO the title of an upcoming talk I'm giving at NCDevCon ([http://ncdevcon.com/](http://ncdevcon.com/)).  I've decided that instead of starting out in power point, I'd write this up as a blog post and think about how to present this stuff on a big screen later.  I do this, not only to have a nice blog post about this stuff, but because I hate looking at power presos on my computer - and I'd rather have something better to share with folks after the presentation.

I'll write this up as a series of posts with this as the main index page.  So below are the main topics in this series!  I'll fill them in with links as I progress, so stay tuned!
