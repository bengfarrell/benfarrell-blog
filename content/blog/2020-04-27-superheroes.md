This was less of an installation, and more of a popup event! The de Young Museum in San Francisco was hosting a "de Youngsters Art Party" and Adobe was there to help out. We created a superhero themed installation where kids could draw their own superhero, and then see it come to life on a screen. The kids could then print out their superhero and take it home with them.
