It's time for another update on Triangle Foodie Happenings! There's a quartet of fun food-themed events coming up in the next two weeks that I thought you should know about.

First up, [Market Restaurant](http://www.eatatmarket.com/) in Raleigh is celebrating their one year anniversary tomorrow, 5/4, which also happens to be my birthday. However, I am not offering half-off beers, cocktails, and wines all day to celebrate! Market has just launched their spring menu, and the half-off drink pricing will extend to Thursday, so check them out!

On Cinco de Mayo, the [Lake Boone Chubby's Tacos](http://www.chubbystacos.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/home.locDetail/locID/2/index.htm) is holding the Chubby's Chowdown at 6 pm. There are two food competitions for the adventurous eater. The first is a challenge to eat your way through Chubby's menu! Participants will be required to eat a taco, gordita, burrito, AND quesadilla in one sitting. The second challenge is chowing your way through a large burrito filled with Chubby's already spicy carne asada. The burrito will be made even hotter than normal by piling in loads of jalapenos and habeneros. Challenge winners will recieve $100 gift cards for Chubby's and t-shirts.

Lest all of Wednesday and Thursday's happening make Friday jealous, there is hope for the Yelpers out there: The Mathletes versus Athletes event on Friday night, 5/6. It's an open party, though you need to RSVP through Yelp, and it's being held at the [Crabtree Tavern](http://www.crabtreetavern.com/) in Raleigh, from 8 pm to 10 pm.  The Tavern will provide free nibbles in the form of lamb sliders with smoked gouda and caramelized onions, crawfish beignets with spicy aioli, short rib crostini, spinach and feta saccotini, various dips, and shrimp and grit cakes. I'm drooling already. Complimentary beers from Fullsteam, Lonerider, Bud Light, and Roth Brewing will also be available. The entertainment is mini golf, double-throw basketball, rescue huskies on the patio, photo booth fun, and free sports massages. After 10 pm, a band will play and the drinks will be on special. I'm definitely heading to this one, and if you'd like more info on how to sign-up, head [here](http://www.yelp.com/events/raleigh-yelps-athletes-vs-mathletes-open-party).

Next up is the Food Blogger Bake Sale, happening on 5/14 from 10 am to 12 pm. It's being held at the Art Market of Vega Metals, which takes place in the parking lot at the corner of Rigsbee and Hunt in Durham. Twenty local food bloggers are baking up either sweet or savory dishes, and for each ticket you purchase, you are entitled to sample one of their wares.  Single tickets are $3 each or you can purchase four for $10, saving you a buck for buying in multiples. Proceeds from the Blogger Bake Sale go to [Share our Strength](http://www.strength.org/), a nonprofit working on ending child hunger. A worthy cause paired with undoubtedly tasty treats! More info can be found [here](http://www.greeneatsblog.com/).

Happy eating!
