It has been too long since I've posted on upcoming Triangle foodie happenings! Apologies galore to those of you who e-mailed me events over the past few months. I've been busy! Busy is a good thing, right?

Anyhow, I've got a list of fun events to share with you all, in order of which is coming up fastest.

South Durham is getting a [Farmer's Market!](http://www.southdurhamfarmersmarket.org/ "South Durham Farmer's Market") The chosen location is the Greenwood Commons Shopping Center in Parkwood, home to [Papa Mojo's,](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2009/08/restaurant-and-cocktail-review-papa-mojos-roadhouse-brunch/ "The Gourmez Papa Mojo's Review") Thai Lanna, and Sarah's Empanadas among other restaurants and stores. It opens this Saturday, and they've got a long list of producers signed on to sell their wares. But for this night owl, the hours are still way too short.

 

 

Much more to my liking is the . . .

**LoMo Market, 5/3 and thereafter, various hours, Triangle-wide**

[LoMo Market](http://lomomarket.com/ "LoMo Market") is a mobile farmer's market that's hitting the road next week. They bring a range of products from local farms and producers to you, wherever you may be! Actually, they are bringing the mobile market to a few areas that pledged the most support in a fundraiser leading up to their first week on the road. The chosen locations gave the most in pledges to purchase from the LoMo Market. Here is the schedule that goes into effect next Wednesday.

## Sundays

11:30am - 1:30pm New Horizon Church, Durham

## Mondays

6:30pm - 8:30pm Croasdaile, Durham

## Tuesdays

10:00am - 12:00pm UNC Wellness at Meadowmont, Chapel Hill

## Wednesdays

10:00am - 12:00pm Rex Wellness Center, Cary

6:30pm - 8:30pm Woodcroft, Durham

## Thursdays

6:30pm - 8:30pm Trinity Park, Durham

See that Woodcroft, Durham, slot? That's where you'll most likely find me checking out the mobile market! In fact, I'm pretty sure I can walk to their chosen location in about three minutes. I think that means I'm obligated to check it out.

My Carpe Durham compatriot, DID, posted [a description](http://carpedurham.com/2012/04/24/magic-wings-festival-beaver-queen-kick-off/ "Carpe Durham") of the Magic Wings Festival over at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham along with a contest for free tickets, so I'm not going to repost that here. What I am doing is pointing it out because they will be serving stir-fried insects at their new cafe, the DARE cafe! I've wanted to try fried insects forever—I do love crustaceans -- but sadly, I have to miss this event.

Written and produced by Eryk Pruitt, formerly of [blu seafood](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2010/06/blu-seafood-and-bar-durham/ "The Gourmez Blu Seafood Review") in Durham and currently of [Sitti](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2011/02/sitti/ "The Gourmez Sitti Review") in Raleigh, [FOODIE](http://foodie-themovie.com/ "Foodie the Movie") is

> a dark comedy about a food-service industry professional who is invited to an exclusive, underground dinner party and discovers there's much more on the menu than he bargained for.  It premieres in Wilmington this Saturday (28th) at the Cape Fear International Film Festival where it is nominated for Best Horror of 2012 and we were lucky enough to get a screening at Motorco on May 17.  Flip from KoKyu BBQ Food Truck has offered to create menu items that reflect the "menu" in the movie, which will be insane!  We're asking for a suggested donation of five dollars at the door to help us with our film festival entry fees (we've applied to Cannes and Sundance... cross your fingers!) and we're planning on having a great time.

I am so bummed I will out of town for that screening! Horror and making fun of foodie culture? It would have been a match made in heaven for me. Plus, I'm sure the [KoKyu](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2011/06/the-bloody-brunch-motorco-and-ko-kyu-bbq/ "The Gourmez KoKyu Review") offerings will be delicious.

 

**Single Source Supper, 6/17, 7 - 10 pm, Hillsborough, $130**

_Daylight_ magazine and Chef Aaron Vandermark of [Panciuto](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2010/12/panciuto/ "The Gourmez Panciuto Review") in Hillsborough are pairing up to create this fantastic evening out in celebration of _Daylight's_ new art space and highlighting the produce found from a single different farm at each meal. As their [website](http://www.daylightmagazine.org/content/single-source-suppers "Single Source Suppers") describes it,

> Our inaugural event will celebrate the launch of the Daylight Project Space in downtown Hillsborough, NC. The night’s events will feature food grown and raised by John Soehner and Cindy Econopouly of [Eco Farm](http://www.ecofarmnc.com/), local beer and wine, live music by [The Hammond Eggs](http://www.reverbnation.com/cornandthecolonels), a series of short film screenings and the quintessential buttered popcorn. We’ll have chairs, but bring a blanket for the movie if you prefer the grass.
>
> **Tentative Menu:** Pan seared sausage with long cooked collards A shot of chilled green garlic cream soup Pulled pork en crescia sfogliata with mustard, arugula, jam and radishes Grilled romaine with radishes, buttermilk dressing and cornbread crumbs Toasted, cold noodle spaghetti with chard-pecan pesto, olive oil, parmesan Chocolate chess pie with strawberries and soft cream
>
> So come sit outside with your neighbors, enjoy some delicious food, great music, watch a movie and help support a local non-profit arts organization. We only have room to host 50 people and we expect to sell out tickets quickly so sign up today!

That's it for this rendition of the Triangle Foodie Happenings. Planning to go to any of them?
