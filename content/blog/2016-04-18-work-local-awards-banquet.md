Help Us Celebrate the Best Local Employers at the Work Local Awards!

The [Work Local Awards](https://www.localwisejobs.com/2016-work-local-awards/) shine the spotlight on the boutiques, cafes, nonprofits, startups, and all the local employers that make our community great.

The awards are presented by [Localwise](https://www.localwisejobs.com), a mission-driven organization focused on helping [local businesses hire local employees](http://localwisejobs.com). Event partners include the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Kiva Zip, and other notable community organizations.

Over 1,000 nominations were submitted for the best employers and 3 finalists were selected in each category. Check out the list of the 47 finalists and their nominations [here](https://www.localwisejobs.com/blog/announcing-the-work-local-awards-finalists/).

The goal of the awards is to not only celebrate the best local employers, but also share best practices that can help other local businesses become great employers.

The winners in each category will be announced at the Work Local Awards Celebration Party on April 28th at [The Port Kaiser Center](http://portworkspaces.com/) in Oakland. The party will bring together local business owners, employees, nonprofits, and community members.

We’d love to see you at the event! [Get your tickets here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/work-local-awards-tickets-22673329539). Enjoy locally made food and drinks from Phil’s Sliders, Hopsy, and more.

Hope to see you there!
