**Region:** Central Coast of California

The description on the back of this bottle declares it to be a remarkably balanced merlot.  Twice.  On first sip, I'd say that's hyperbole.  Spices are the most prominent component, kind of like taking a bite of an old-fashioned stick of clove gum. It smells like raspberry and leather but tastes more like bark than leather going down, with a bit of moss on the strip.  Yes, I know how moss tastes—I had an adventuresome childhood.  The raspberry flavor is subtler and has that overly juicy taste like they've just started getting mealy.  I would definitely not call it balanced but it did mellow out with each sip and grew on me.
