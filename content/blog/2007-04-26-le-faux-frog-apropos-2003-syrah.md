**Le Faux Frog** Other stuff on the label: Appropos 2003 Syrah

Color: Deep purple, with a thin opaque layer at the top. Smell: At most, a bit of warmth is smelled. Nothing else. First Sip: Very smooth going down and a bit bitter. Woody. Gulp: A longer swirl round the palate reveals pepper, wood, and a lightly smoky ambience. The acidity almost makes me twinge but the peppery finish is good. Otherwise, it's a fairly bland Syrah but smooth is better than strongly undrinkable.
