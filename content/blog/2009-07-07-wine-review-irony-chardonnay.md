**Other words on the label:** Napa Valley 2005, The finest traditions in winemaking since 1935, 14.5% alcohol

The nose smells of cantaloupe and caramel.  It's sweeter than I expect for a chardonnay and is dripping with vanilla, cantaloupe and green apple.  Just as the bottle label says, the sip ends with a creamy finish that sums up the experience: rich, fruity, juicy.
