Tim Cunningham, of www.cfmumbojumbo.com, needed a logo for his podcast/radio show where he does quick interviews featuring one guest per show.

I helped him out, starting with a few variations on a concept I came up with.

Tim picked a concept after asking around, and I finally added some color and depth while coming up with a wide version and a square version:
