            <p>
                Ben gives a quick run-down on what we'll learn and build today, the technologies we'll use, who we'll
                be talking to, and what they built.

            <p>
                Ben sits down with Christian Cantrell who describes his day-job as the intersection of creativity and AI. He's the VP of Product for Stability.ai. We chat about
                how Stable Diffusion could be changing creative output, and delve into his writing process using image generation. We also talk a bit about Stability.ai and it's
                role in offering APIs to empower all of this.

            <p>
                Due to unforeseen circumstances, Ben and his space lab come crashing back down to Earth. An effort is made to depict this with AI generated art
                using Stable Diffusion. Once Ben is in the safety of his home office, he talks about running Stable Diffusion locally on an M1 based Macbook Pro,
                using Node.js as a server to make the call into Python and Stable Diffusion, and finally replacing an image tag on a web page with a custom made Web
                Component that loads the AI generated image. All of this is done with a hand rolled Chrome Extension. We'll cover it all!

            <p>
                In this video, we turn to simplyrecipes.com and their recipe for orange breakfast rolls. We use our new Chrome Extension to swap images with those
                generated by Stable Diffusion using Simply Recipe's own accessibility text.
