**Fruit Tree in the Forest** ![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/fruittree.jpg)

2 shots New Amsterdam Gin 0.5 shot St. Germaine Elderflower Liquor 1 shot lemonade 2 shots Choya Ume

Shake together the gin and elderflower and pour into a martini glass. Slowly pour the lemonade on top. Take a break to feed the cats who are complaining. Shake the Choya Ume to chill it then slowly pour it on top of the others.Â  You could just shake it all together, but I wanted to layer the flavors unevenly, so there might be interesting differences with each sip.

I think I succeeded. This might be the first good cocktail I've made at home in months. Yes, I restocked the bar; why do you ask? It's sweet but not cloyingly so. I think the mellow ume, bright elderflower, and gin flavors play quite well together, and the lemonade provides a great meeting ground for them. Give it a try!
