Codebass Radio is "Where Geek and Music Combine".  It's an awesome developer/geek/nerd oriented internet radio station founded by Vicky Ryder.  I'm an eternally grateful to be her Senior Producer at the station - trying to step in and help where I can, as well as run two radio shows of my own.

Check out [CodebassRadio.net](http://CodebassRadio.net) or [listen live right now](http://cbrtune.in/) - There exists a show for every taste, and the schedule is chock full or fresh content every workday.
