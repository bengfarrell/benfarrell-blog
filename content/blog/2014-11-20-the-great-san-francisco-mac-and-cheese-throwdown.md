When four, count 'em four, friends contacted me this week to make sure I was aware of this event, I realized I'd made a bit of a mac-and-cheese-tasting reputation for myself.

This throwdown comes your way through the combined efforts of the [SoMa StrEat Food Park](http://somastreatfoodpark.com/) and [FunCheapSF,](http://sf.funcheap.com/) both great organizations with a goal of keeping Bay Area residents in good food for fair prices. In addition to over 10 food trucks offering their mac and cheese spins, there will also be games, beer specials, and a cheesy cover band. And yes, that's the precise language used to describe the band.

**What**: the Great San Francisco Mac and Cheese Throwdown

**Where**: SoMa StrEat Food Park, 428 11th Street, San Francisco.

**When:** 11/22 from 11am to 5pm.

**How Much**: $5 for entry, which includes 1 tasting ticket OR $20 for a passport that includes entry, 5 tasting tickets, and a PBR. Individual tasting tickets are $4 each.

**Get me tickets:** [Order them through Eventbrite here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-great-san-francisco-mac-and-cheese-throwdown-tickets-14365304011?discount=funcheap)

Unfortunately, I will not be attending the throwdown because I already have plans Saturday and because I'm pretty sure that many mac and cheese options are too many even for me. But my quest to conquer _7 x 7'_s list of the best Bay Area mac and cheeses continues, and [my most recent post on that is here](https://www.thegourmez.com/blog/2014/10/mac-cheese-night-5-american-grilled-cheese-kitchen/). Coming up soon are my thought's on Paragon's offering and then theÂ Mac and Cheese nights will continue after the New Year. Only 4 to go!
