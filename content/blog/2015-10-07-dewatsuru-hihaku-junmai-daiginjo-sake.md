It’s been too long since I’ve bought a nice bottle of sake, and what a bottle to choose! I didn’t choose it, actually. [Underground Cellars](http://thegourmez.com/2015/03/06/underground-cellar/), an online wine club with randomized bottle upgrades, chose it for me by upgrading one of my soju purchases to this beautiful rice wine instead.

The nose is very creamy, and the coloring’s light yellow like a chardonnay or sauvignon blanc. You’ll get a mouth full of thick banana pudding, and a delicious one at that. It’s fresh, nothing like an abandoned, plastic-encased pudding in a cold case and everything like your Southern Great-Aunt Dinah just pulled it from her refrigerator. Chilled, crushed violet comes out as a lingering aftertaste.

The Dewatsuru Hihaku Junmai Daiginjo had strong aromatics and presented an elegant and complex taste, with notes of melon, floral elements and a touch of red fruit.
