Blastanova aims to be _the_ new independent music discovery method. It strives for the middle ground between finding random bands online and listening to the top 40 on endless loops. To accomplish this, tons of great music blogs are scanned three times a day. Songs and videos are beamed up from the blogs to Blastanova’s playlists, Twitter, and Facebook streams every day.

Blastanova is my first serious attempt at Node.js work.  The back end of this system uses Node.js, MongoDB, and some media utilities to go out and grab links to songs on various music blogs.  From there I tweet them out and gather them up into a daily playlist powered with HTML5 audio.  It works pretty well on various devices as a web app, but I've also made a Windows 8 Application from it.  Coming soon will be Phonegap style Android and iOS apps.
