2 shots Two Fingers Gold Tequila\
0.5 shot Feeney's Irish Cream Liquor\
4-second pour of Hershey's Nonfat Chocolate Syrup\
4 shots orange juice, heavy pulp Â 'cos that's how I roll\
Sprinkle of cinnamon

Shake the first four ingredients and pour over crushed ice. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.

This cocktail, by all rights, should not be drinkable. But it is! I think it's the orange and irish cream; I simply love an orange creamsicle, 50-50 bar, whatever you want to call them. I definitely added too much cinnamon on top, and I think I should have gone with my gut and sprinkled cardamom instead. The chocolate is in a very small portion and that works to its benefit, merely adding a velvety richness. The tequila works surprisingly well. Drinkable, but I'll definitely make improvements next time.
