**Other words on the label:** Louis Jadot 2006

This was my first burgundy ever. Just thought you'd like to know.

The wine is tart, which is a trainwreck with the cayenne-accented pizza in my mouth. Besides my ill-advised meal choice, the wine by itself tastes of an extra creamy key lime pie. It has a lot of body and if I try hard enough, I can also taste the graham cracker crust.
