Time for an update of foodie events coming your way—if you happen to live here, in Triangle, NC, foodie heaven, that is. For those of you lucky enough t o share this region blessed with great produce and talented chefs (including this year's James Beard Chef of the Southeast, Andrea Reusing!), these are some activities worth checking out:

﻿﻿[![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/06/TRWcrest-Red-271x300.png "TRWcrest-Red")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/06/TRWcrest-Red.png)Did you know we're in the midst of Triangle Restaurant Week? Feels like it was just a couple months since the last one! Oh, it was? Well, who am I to complain about another week of restaurants trying out new dishes and offering them at an affordable price? In fact, I already tried [buku'](http://www.bukuraleigh.com "Buku")s menu this week, and I can highly recommend their samosas for the appetizer round. What's Triangle Restaurant Week, you ask? It's an opportunity for diners to check out a restaurant's offerings on a cheaper-than-normal tasting menu ($30 for dinner, $20 for lunch) of 3 courses. Usually, you pick from a few options each for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. No special reservations needed; participating restaurants will offer you the restaurant week menu in addition to their regular menu when you show up. More details including the restaurant participants can be found [here](http://www.blvd.tv/trw/ "Triangle Restaurant Week"). You only have until Sunday, so get going!

 

Enjoy a spirit-enhanced cake? Chez Moi, a home-based bakery focusing on tasty, moist, flavorful desserts using rum (brown sugar vanilla and chocolate raspberry) or vodka (appletini) is hoping to purchase a vehicle to they can take their cakes to the streets! There's a [kickstarter campaig](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1068496825/chez-moi-on-wheels "Chez Moi campaign")n running now to raise the $3500 needed for Chez Moi to purchase mobility. 28 days left and they are almost halfway to their goal. If you'd love to walk up to a truck and take home a delicious, alcohol-based treat, then donate now. Plus, most donation levels include a free cake once the truck is up and running.

[Tickets are already available](http://www.terravitaevent.com/TerraVITA/HOME.html "TerraVITA's Website") for the 2nd TerraVITA festival taking place on September 24, 2011. TerraVita is a food and wine festival that's focused on promoting sustainable agriculture. Not only does it include the Grand Tasting with samples of food from North Carolinian chefs and wines from local and international distributors, but those wanting to learn more about the industry of providing sustainable food can participate in the sustainable classroom, learning about a range of topics from the people who work in this field every day. The Grand Tasting is $65, the sustainable classroom fee is $35, or you can participate in both for $90. Interested? Check out my blog on [last year's TerraVITA,](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=1691 "TerraVITA report") the very first!

Last, but certainly not least, [Margaux's Restaurant](http://www.margauxsrestaurant.com/# "Margaux's Restaurant") is holding their annual Lobster Fest on Thursday, 6/16, from 5:30 to 9:00 pm! Three-, five-, and ten-pound lobsters will be steamed and served whole on their lovely patio. Live music will be playing. Accompanying dishes so far include white lobster pizza, filet mignon with lobster tail, lobster tostadas, prosciutto-wrapped lobster nuggets, and a chilled lobster, crab, and shrimp martini. Reservations are required, so call (919) 846-9846 if you'd like to reserve a spot for this lobsterlicious event.

Enjoy!
