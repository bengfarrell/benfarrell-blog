Readers, I know I'm not in North Carolina anymore (though I will be in Raleigh the weekend of 9/13--let's get together, locals!), but I had to make sure you knew that tickets for Chapel Hill's TerraVita went on sale today. Why? Because TerraVita is an amazing conference focused on food, drink, and ways to enjoy them sustainably, a cause I couldn't support more.

I've had the pleasure of attending twice in its five-year history. It's been amazing since [Year 1,](https://www.thegourmez.com/blog/2010/10/terravita-the-first-biodynamic-and-sustainable-food-and-drink-fair-of-the-southeast/ "TerraVITA year 1 write-up") really, but the festival stepped up its game when it added on the [Sustainable Classroom,](https://www.thegourmez.com/blog-2012-12-the-sustainable-classroom-3-the-cultivation-and-culinary-possibilities-of-figs/ "Figs Sustainable Classroom write-up") two days of workshops offered by local and national chefs, baristas, writers, owners, and producers that all tackle the appreciation of food from the perspective of how to keep the industry sustainable so we can keep on appreciating that food forever.

New this year, TerraVita is hosting the premiere of _A Chef's Life_ Season 2, the Peabody-winning PBS program based on the day-to-day life of Chef Vivian Howard of Kinston's [Chef and the Farme](https://www.thegourmez.com/blog/2013-04-kinston-nc-blogging-chef-and-the-farmer/ "My Chef and the Farmer review")r restaurant. And the number of special dinners that the 3-Day pass offers is blowing my mind. I wish I could be at each one!

I'm copying over the press release for you now, because the whole thing is making me jealous of those of you who plan to go. I encourage you to buy tickets for at least one event if responsible food consumerism is your passion. You can do that at their website, [right here.](http://www.terravitaevent.com/ "TerraVita")

> \[Chapel Hill, NC, July 8, 2014\] – TerraVita Food & Drink Event ([www.TerraVitaEvent.com](http://www.TerraVitaEvent.com); October 9-11, 2014; @TerraVitafoodie) – named one of the “10 Southern Food Festivals You Need to Taste” by _The Atlanta Journal-Constitution_ and “4 Can’t Miss Southern Food Festivals” by _PeterGreenberg.com_ – has earned its [reputation as a premier culinary event in the Southeast](http://www.ajc.com/news/lifestyles/sightseeing/10-southern-festivals-you-need-to-taste/nTcg8/) because of its devotion to highlighting local and sustainable food and beverages of superior quality. “In honor of our fifth year, we’ve taken the festival to a new level. This year we’re honored to host the North Carolina premiere of the second season of the award-winning PBS series **_A Chef’s Life_**, with Chef Vivian Howard – a longtime TerraVita supporter,” said Colleen Minton, the festival’s founder and director. Additional dinners, tasting events, educational classrooms, after parties, chef demos, and a special 3-day pass have also been added this year.
