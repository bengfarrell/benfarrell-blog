I was e-mailed this press release a couple of days ago for an event that sounds fantastic: eat soup made by Durham's top chefs, vote on your favorites, take home an artisan bowl, and contribute to Urban Ministries of Durham all for $30 per ticket. It's being held on 3/5/10 and I'm of a mind to attend . . . except that it's on my fourth anniversary of marriage, so I'm making no commitments yet. But YOU, my faithful foodie readers, definitely should check out this event. Information follows:

**Serving Up Bowls of Hope at Urban Ministries of Durham's Empty Bowls ’10 Fundraiser**

Steaming bowls of soup served up by some of Durham's top restaurants offer hope to those who need it most.

The special fundraising event, Empty Bowls ‘10, brings together the best of Durham to raise funds to support Urban Ministries of Durham’s efforts to provide hot meals and fill the food pantry for those who would otherwise go without. In light of current economic crisis, organizations like UMD offer a safety net for those who need it most.

The event will be held on Friday, March 5 at the Durham Armory, 220 Foster Street in Durham, from 5:30 to 8:00 p.m.

No bowls will be empty as attendees sample tasty soups from Durham's best chefs. This year, chefs from blu seafood & bar, Papa Mojo's Roadhouse, Revolution, Nana’s, and other top restaurants will serve up their best for the cause.

Local celebrities –including North Carolina General Assembly Representative Henry (Mickey) Michaux, Jr. - will be the judges to award the coveted “Best Soup in Durham." Attendees will also get in on the fun picking their favorite.

Tickets are $30 each, which includes a one-of-a-kind keepsake bowl created by a local artisan. There are also tickets available for $15 if participants want to sample soup only. Children 6 and under are free.

This soup-tasting event makes a perfect evening for business professionals and families.

Empty Bowls ‘10 is made possible by Presenting Sponsor MindWorks Multimedia, Platinum Sponsor Quintiles, Gold Sponsors Apogee Medical and Tracy Bissette, and others.

Due to the popularity of this event, tickets are limited. Tickets are available for purchase at the UMD website [http://www.umdurham.org](http://www.umdurham.org/), by calling UMD at (919) 682-0538 or in person at 410 Liberty Street, Durham.

Throughout the night, attendees be tweeting soup reviews with the hashtag #EmptyBowls.
