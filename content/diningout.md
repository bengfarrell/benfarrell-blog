<h1>Dining out</h1>

I judge eateries based on their class—I don’t expect a fast casual restaurant to have the same level of service as a fine dining establishment, nor would I want it to. The only thing that truly matters at an eatery is the food itself. It’s highly likely that a shawarma wrap served in a red basket will blow my mind as much as an expertly crafted lobster bisque.

Service is much less important than the food on my plate, but I do have OPINIONS. While I have occasionally appreciated paying by QR code at an understaffed chain restaurant, I view QR menus as lazy and cheap—I’m sorry, they just suck. I don’t want waiters waiting to refill my every sip of water, but I do want initial service for drinks and ordering within a reasonable time frame after seating. I also like to be asked what else I need shortly after food is delivered, because if I’m having fries, I’ll need that side of ranch. If a restaurant’s gone the extra mile to make their vibe inviting and fun, I’ll enjoy it, but most of the time, a clean table really is enough.

Prior to the pandemic, we rarely ordered delivery and I rarely reviewed a restaurant when I ordered to-go. I don’t anticipate that changing much; I prefer being able to share the full restaurant experience when I’m posting about a new-to-me spot. That said, bakery items are likely to be reviewed at home, because I’m likely buying a bunch of different items to try at my leisure.

Lastly, after a decade in the Bay Area, my ability to judge value in pricing is completely whack. This is one of the most expensive places to live in the world, to the point that I have never been surprised by how expensive meals are when traveling – not in London, nor Vancouver, nor Tokyo. Not even at Disney World. I may occasionally share a good deal, but you must understand, that good deal is only good compared with what I normally pay in the Bay.
