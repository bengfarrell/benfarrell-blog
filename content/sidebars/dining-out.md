Whether fine or casual dining, the layered flavors and textures in my meal impress me most. That could mean a delicious, smoky soup with fresh herbs and crunchy bits on top, or a classic hamburger with just the right amount of mayo and char from the grill. In terms of atmosphere, I prefer brighter lighting and a modern feel—I want to see the beautiful food I’ve ordered! But service matters very little to me beyond being able to find someone when it’s time for the check. Learn more about my posts on eateries here [link to Dining Out Page]
