I’ve been sharing my food, drink, and travel experiences with the world as The Gourmez since 2007! I think of myself as less of a reviewer and more as someone who demystifies places and products for my readers. This blog began in North Carolina, but it’s been headquartered in California’s East Bay since 2013. Learn more about my reviewing philosophy [Link to The Gourmez’s Review Philosophy page] and my background here [link to About the Gourmez].
