My ideal coffee shop harkens back to my college days in Santa Cruz, CA, which had many that fit the bill. Ambience matters most: plentiful seating, accessible outlets, hopefully some comfy chairs and sofas scattered about. I love a café that feels like an expanded living room where working, studying, and the hum of friends catching up over a cup of joe are all welcome. A tasty food menu is a plus, but what’s more important is a barista who knows not to burn the milk—oat or almond for me, please!
