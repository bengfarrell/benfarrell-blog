My portfolio has never been maintained well. Between projects that are under NDA, not having an actual portfolio site/structure to
post to sporadically, and not really knowing how to organize it because I've done so many different things, it's a mess.

This is heavily under construction, but I'm leaving it here to guilt myself into doing something about it.
