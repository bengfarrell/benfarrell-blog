**Adobe | Design Prototyping 2018 - present**

Brought designs and concepts to life through design-led prototyping efforts, mainly on the web. As a "Design Engineer", I can step into product engineering roles, brand new startup efforts, and design thinking/experimentation. Projects ranged from photo/video editing tools, generative AI, design systems, 3D/mixed reality, Acrobat, as well as brand new product verticals. Led development efforts around pro bono installations for the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego, as well as the de Young and SFMOMA museums in San Francisco. As Staff Engineer, I gave internal talks and gave experienced support to others on my team.

 

**Adobe | Design Lab 2015 - 2018**

Designed and implemented new project ideas with a small team of designers and developers. Mainly focused on Web based work, but also did desktop development with Unity. Every year one of my projects was featured at Adobe MAX Sneaks. Also gave internal talks and workshops on mixed reality, leading to a "Top 10" award for an "Intro to VR" session at our bi-annual tech summit. Our pro bono efforts with SFMOMA led to a Comm Arts award of excellence in 2017 for our "Self Composed" installation.

 

**General Electric | Lead Design Technologist 2013 - 2015**

At GE, my work mostly consisted of maintaining a family of products called the "GE Design System". I worked with several groups representing different interests at GE including Healthcare, Marketing, and Industrial (power, water, gas, etc). Work included new components for the system, architectural decisions, a testing initiative, and more. The design system itself is meant as production ready HTML for customer applications, training, and design guidance. Other related initiatives I worked on included a font-icon creation tool, HTML5 video training material, and web consistency testing tools based on Grunt/NodeJS.

 

**Digitalsmiths | Senior Software Engineer, 2008-present**

My work at Digitalsmiths mainly included work as the lead developer on video players used on high profile sites like TMZ.com, theWB.com, and cwtv.com. In the beginning of my employment, I took 20+ Flash video players for our customer sites, and streamlined them down to one highly customizable video player product. The look and feel was customizable, as well as other things including which 3rd party ad platforms and reporting components were used. This accomplishment allowed us to work as a team and efficiently use our source control and continuous integration systems to make reliable releases of our product.

I continued on work with the CW and WB in project managing and developing iOS, Android, XBOX, Windows 8, and HTML5 video players.  Working with Turner Sports and the PGA, my project received an Emmy for innovative sports coverage.

I also regularly spent time communicating with clients and 3rd party vendors in meetings for integration planning and troubleshooting.

Aside from players, I also built end to end video web applications and demos using Flash, HTML5, Python, and MongoDB.

 

**360KID | Senior Software Developer, 2003-2008**

360Kid is a software development company dedicated to doing education and edutainment software. I have completed work for a number of high profile clients like the Sesame Workshop, Pokemon, Nickelodeon Jr, Discovery Channel, and the Princeton Review.

In addition to the big name clients, we've recieved some big recognition for our work as well. Our Sesame Workshop Cable Television projects earned us three Emmy nominations, one of which was earned by a project led by myself. Pokemon Learning League, also a project led by me, we've earned three educational awards and are still counting. I'd led and been a part of many more projects, always achieving success and earning client praise.

I've used a variety of tools and skills in our projects including Flash, Flex, Javascript, HTML, PHP, ASP, ASP.NET/C#, AJAX, Director, Zinc, and more. Typically our projects use Flash, and clean, understandable, organized code is essential. Also essential is the ability to work with our art team and make sure their vision comes through to the final product.

My graphic design and user interface design skills have come through as well. Though not part of my job description as a programmer, I often offer an educated opinion for how to design our projects. Every once in a while, I'll even design them myself.

I've also received praise for being able to communicate complicated concepts to non-technical people. This can be very useful when talking with clients, or especially helping out with RFP's.
