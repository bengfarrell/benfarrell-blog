<h1>Nightlife & Cocktails</h1>

When I started writing about cocktails, I was learning about them myself for the first time, having grown up in a household where alcohol was not consumed. So I’d savor each sip, see if I could pick out the listed ingredients, and developed my preferences over time. I’m a sucker for an absinthe rinse, mezcal, dark rum, and spicy ingredients when I see them on a drink list. That said, I am most looking for balance in a cocktail, hoping to be amazed at how well inventive ingredients come together in the glass. Give me your basil eau de vie, your spiced chocolate sugar syrups, your smoked sea salt rims! A consistent classic cocktail can be nice, but a classic with a twist is even nicer.

Most of my reviews in this category are of a single cocktail enjoyed out. But I do cover a range of nightlife beverages and venues. If I’m in a wine bar, chances are I’m going for a wine flight because I simply must TRY ALL THE THINGS. Same goes for a beer sampler, though I like most styles of wine and far fewer of beer (stouts and hazy IPAs are my preferred beers by far). When I have multiple items to taste, I am hoping that while I’m comparing sips, something will bring a sparkle to my eye, either in contrast with another glass or with subtle similarities.

In terms of where I’m drinking, I’m drawn toward places that have their own cocktail list, but I appreciate an accepting dive bar crowd that doesn’t mind if I’m reading or typing on my laptop in a corner. I’m extra pleased if a local joint can make me a decent cosmopolitan, but dive bars are more about a welcoming atmosphere than bartending skills. I prefer if the music stays in the background, and I’m not likely to join the dance floor. But your moves may put a smile on my face.

Cheesy décor on the walls? I’M ALL IN. But let’s keep the lights bright enough that I can read your cocktail list, please? Or at least light enough to get a good picture of my beverage. I’m just not a lowlight sort of gal, as my husband could tell you. He’d prefer mood lighting every day in the living room, but I’m quick to flip that overhead light switch.
