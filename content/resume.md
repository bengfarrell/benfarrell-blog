I've been creatively coding for 20 years (ever since a freshman in college).   I'm an expert UI developer, but can also do a mean impersonation of a designer/illustrator. I've done everything from Flash to Javascript to iOS to Android, and even some devices, platforms and hardware that you haven't heard of.

Most noteably, I've recieved Emmy nominations, wrote a book on Web Components, spoken at conferences, taught at Harvard, and am constantly exploring and playing with technology and code. Currently, I'm on a design-led Prototyping team at Adobe exploring augmented reality.

My past clients have included The WB, The CW, YouTube, TMZ, The Ellen Degeneres Show, The Bonnie Hunt Show, Extra TV, The Tyra Banks Show, Pokemon, Nickelodeon Jr, Sesame Workshop, PBS Kids, Discovery Channel, The Princeton Review, McGraw Hill, Houghton Mifflin, Riverdeep Interactive, Philips Medical, DSW Shoes, Prentice Hall, SFMOMA, Museum of Photographic Arts
