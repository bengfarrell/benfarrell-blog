I've been creatively coding for 25 years.   Though, I've spent my career in UI development, I've been fortunate enough to work with lots of designers where I've been exposed to design thinking and been assured I can hold my own as a designer. I've done everything from Flash to Javascript to iOS to Android, and even some devices, platforms and hardware that you haven't heard of.

In addition to design, I've done lots of media production, whether it's image editing, illustration, video editing, 3D modeling/texturing, as well as 2D/3D animation.

I'm proud to say that I've received more than a few awards for my work including Emmys and Emmy nominations. I wrote a book on Web Components, spoken at conferences, taught at Harvard, and am constantly exploring and playing with technology and code. Currently, I'm on a Prototyping team at Adobe as a Design Engineer.

My past clients have included The WB, The CW, YouTube, TMZ, The Ellen Degeneres Show, The Bonnie Hunt Show, Extra TV, The Tyra Banks Show, Pokemon, Nickelodeon Jr, Sesame Workshop, PBS Kids, Discovery Channel, The Princeton Review, McGraw Hill, Houghton Mifflin, Riverdeep Interactive, Philips Medical, DSW Shoes, Prentice Hall, SFMOMA, Museum of Photographic Arts, and the de Young Museum.
