**Web Components in Space!**

A video series for making Web Components with experimental and/or cutting edge web tech. Join me, resident Web Componaut, in my space lab for exploration, interviews, and labs where we build stuff with the help of our trusty friend, the Web Compono-tron.

**Blastanova**

Not publicly available yet!

Soon to be a free music discovery platform that aggregates music from independent focused music blogs. Blastanova will promote the music and the blog it came from, while giving users a downloadable playlist of tunes (hopefully new stuff every day)

**MediaSlurp**

MediaSlurp was developed with communities in mind. We saw a need, a need for a tool that aggregates community-driven multimedia content. The tool had to be easy and fun to use, and provide timely information relevant to the user. Our goal is to provide that tool to you and enhance it over time with your feedback. MediaSlurp is built on Adobe AIR™ using the Flex SDK. The first version was built in approximately three weeks by three developers, attesting to the rapid development capability that the Adobe platform provides.

Adrian and Ben broadcast live from the American Tobacco Campus in Durham, NC, talking about software development and the local tech scene. Follow us @RTExpectations or @Codebass to find out when the next show will be.

If you miss the show, that’s okay, we missed you, too.  You can listen to our previous shows as podcasts once we have them.

Tune into Codebass radio to hear us.  Expect some runtime . . .things?
