<h1>Disclosures</h1>

This is my personal blog. No one pays me to write its content, though it pays me back through the knowledge of food and drink I’ve gathered over the years.

However, I do occasionally enjoy perks. And by perks, I mean free meals, products, and alcohol samples provided by a company, PR firm, or individual hoping for coverage on this blog. Those have run the gamut from full dinners with wine pairings to a handful of granola bars.

When I write about a perk, I disclose that the goods or services were provided for free within the body of the post. Usually, they begin with an obnoxious “Obligatory Disclaimer” right at top. Does receiving a

perk affect my objectivity? I’d like to believe it does not, but that’s up to you to discern. It does, more often than not, mean I’m writing about something I would not have thought to otherwise.

I currently (February 2024) have no active affiliate marketing partnerships, though you may see references in my blog posts to the ones I’ve had in the past. Those included NakedWines.Com and MonthlyClubs.Com. I am open to considering affiliate marketing again, but honestly, it’s usually not worth the hassle of setting up. I am definitely open to solicitations for product reviews and samples, but I do not guarantee a positive review, and my approach is to review anything I write about from the average consumer’s perspective.

Any questions about my disclosure policy? Want to send some samples my way or contact me about covering an event or new menu item on my blog? Email me at becca@thegourmez.com. You can send direct messages to me on my social media platforms [link to About the Gourmez page], but I’m much better at following up via email.
