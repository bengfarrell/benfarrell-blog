<h1>Spirits</h1>

When I’m evaluating a spirit or a liqueur for the first time, I start by smelling it right above the glass – don’t go too far in, or you’ll only burn your nose hairs! Next, I go for a small sip, then a larger sip that I roll around in my mouth before swallowing, followed by releasing an alcohol-heavy breath. After that, I try it with a little water and imagine what other spirits and mixers it may combine well with and if it’s worthy of sipping on its own. If I’m inspired, I may come up with a cocktail recipe or simply try it in a classic one, instead.

I am usually tasting spirits at home, though distilleries are quite fun to visit [link to search category distillery, distilleries]. When not sampling something new, my preferences lately have been to enjoy whiskey or aged rums and tequila on their own with a couple cubes of ice. If the alcohol heat is too much, I’ll add sparkling water or maybe tonic. That’s called lazy drinking, rather than a cocktail, and knowing if a spirit or liqueur is suitable for it is helpful, too. I hope to start evaluating bitters soon too. Suggestions? Email me.
