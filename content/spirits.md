<h1>Spirits</h1>

When I’m evaluating a spirit or a liqueur for the first time, I start by smelling it right above the glass—don’t go too far in, or you’ll burn your nose hairs! Next, I go for a small sip, then a larger sip that I roll around in my mouth before swallowing, followed by releasing an alcohol-heavy breath. After that, I try it with a little water and imagine what other spirits and mixers it may combine well with and if it’s worthy of sipping on its own. If I’m inspired, I may come up with a cocktail recipe or simply try it in a classic one.

I am usually tasting spirits at home, though distilleries are quite fun to visit. When not sampling something new, my preferences lately have been to enjoy whiskey or aged rums and tequila on their own with a couple cubes of ice. If the alcohol heat is too much, I’ll add sparkling water or maybe tonic. That’s called lazy drinking, rather than a cocktail, and knowing if a spirit or liqueur is suitable for it is helpful, too. I hope to start evaluating bitters soon too. Suggestions? Email me.
